## Usage

##### Install plugin for fastlane
[install instructions](https://docs.fastlane.tools/plugins/using-plugins/)
```
bundle exec fastlane add_plugin taiwan_number_one
```
but I personally prefer adding plugin in `Gemfile` like this to avoid additional `Pluginfile` in ~'your_ios_project_dir'/fastlane

```
bundle add fastlane-plugin-taiwan_number_one
```

##### Show info

```
bundle exec fastlane action taiwan_number_one
```

##### Use in a Fastfile

you can create a custom lane like this:
```
desc "handle app release decision"
lane :release_decision do |options|
  taiwan_number_one(
    username: username,
    app_identifier: app_identifier,
    app_decision: options[:app_decision],
    api_key: api_key
  )
end
```

and this:
```
desc "release App store version"
lane :release_app do
  result = release_decision(app_decision: Fastlane::Actions::TaiwanNumberOneAction::DecisionType::RELEASE)
  if result == Fastlane::Actions::TaiwanNumberOneAction::ActionResult::SUCCESS
    # do your thing here!
  end
end
```

or this:
```
desc "reject App store version"
lane :reject_app do
  api_key = app_store_connect_api_key(
    key_id: ENV["ASC_API_KEY_ID"],
    issuer_id: ENV["ISSUER_ID"],
    key_content: ENV["ASC_API_KEY"]
  )
  release_decision(app_decision: Fastlane::Actions::TaiwanNumberOneAction::DecisionType::REJECT)
end
```

*for more info about app_store_connect_api_key, please refer to [here](http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/app_store_connect_api_key/#app_store_connect_api_key) and [here](http://docs.fastlane.tools/app-store-connect-api/#using-an-app-store-connect-api-key)

Since there might have some problem in `reject_if_possible` of `Deliver`, so it's better to call this Action before `Deliver` everytime.

something like this:
```
desc "build and upload production app with info to App Store Connet"
lane :upload_production_and_testFlight do |options|
  ...
  release_decision(app_decision: options[:app_decision])
  deliver(...)
  ...
end
```

or 

```
release_decision(app_decision: Fastlane::Actions::TaiwanNumberOneAction::DecisionType::RELEASE)

release_decision(app_decision: Fastlane::Actions::TaiwanNumberOneAction::DecisionType::REJECT)
```

#### Use in terminal

Run `taiwan_number_one` to release or reject only when the reviewed version status is `Pending Developer Release`, otherwise do nothing.

```
bundle exec fastlane release_decision app_decision:"reject" username:"your apple id" app_identifier:"bundle id"
bundle exec fastlane release_decision app_decision:"release" username:"your apple id" app_identifier:"bundle id"
```

##### Default values
`taiwan_number_one` has a default `release` app_decision, which allow you to release the `Pending Developer Release` version when you donâ€™t provide a specific app_decision value.
