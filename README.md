https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/17539

## Usage

##### Show info

```
bundle exec fastlane action taiwan_number_one
```

##### Use in a Fastfile

you can create a custom lane like this:
```
desc "handle app release decision"
lane :release_decision do |options|
  taiwan_number_one(
    username: username,
    app_identifier: app_identifier,
    app_decision: options[:app_decision]
  )
end
```

Since there might have some problem in `reject_if_possible` of `Deliver`, so it's better to call this Action before `Deliver` everytime.

something like this:
```
desc "build and upload production app with info to App Store Connet"
lane :upload_production_and_testFlight do |options|
  ...
  release_decision(app_decision: options[:app_decision])
  deliver(...)
  ...
end
```

or 

```
release_decision(app_decision: Fastlane::Actions::TaiwanNumberOneAction::DicisionType::RELEASE)

release_decision(app_decision: Fastlane::Actions::TaiwanNumberOneAction::DicisionType::REJECT)
```

#### Use in terminal

Run `taiwan_number_one` to release or reject only when the reviewed version status is `Pending Developer Release`, otherwise do nothing.

```
bundle exec fastlane release_decision app_decision:"reject" username:"your apple id" app_identifier:"bundle id"
bundle exec fastlane release_decision app_decision:"release" username:"your apple id" app_identifier:"bundle id"
```

##### Default values
`taiwan_number_one` has a default `release` app_decision, which allow you to release the `Pending Developer Release` version when you donâ€™t provide a specific app_decision value.
